**Our Suggestions **
1. This task can also be accomplished using a calendar component.
2. We can bind data to the calendar instead of creating a table.
3. This will resemble Google Calendar's appearance.
4. When we click on a specific date, we can display a popup with the data, and we can also edit that popup.
5. In the popup, we can include a "Save" button, which will save the edited data.
